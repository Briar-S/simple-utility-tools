## About

### Functionality

* the utility requires the input of 3 files. 2 files to compare, 1 output file
* it will then write to the output file a line by line list of lines from file 2 that were not in file 1
* this order can be swapped in the utility i.e. print lines that are only in file 1 instead
* you can also choose whether to completely overwrite the output file, or write the comparison to the end of the output document

### Why

* i created this because i wanted a fast and clean way to generate a text file with lines only existing in one of 2 files
* useful for quick db comparisons mainly
