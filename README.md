# Simple Utility Tools

## About

* Some utilities created over time in software development
  * This will likely include some forks/clones of other peoples projects as well

#### Why?
* Because although finding some of these tools is easy, finding ones that are 'safe' enough for corporate environments is not.
* These aim of these utilities is to create tools that are:
  * Easy to edit for different, individual situations
  * Lightweight enough so that they can be installed on most machines
  * Safe enough for corporate IT to allow you to use them
  * Simple enough that people unfamiliar with programming can still use them
